I always had an interest in computers, softwares and programming. Life took me down another path until recently. 
I got to the point that I have to change career because of my newly aquired physical disability. I had to ask myself, 
what would you want to do with your new life now? As I ask the question to myslef a little spark in me lightend up and said: "Go coding!" :) .... 
So I started learning Python!
